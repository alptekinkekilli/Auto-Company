## Summary

Fetches a Turkish public procurement (KİK) decision page in a single call and returns a compact digest: decision number/date, meeting/agenda numbers, contracting authority, tender reference, complainant (explicitly distinguished from an excluded firm), the operative 'karar verildi' sentence, and the canonical content hash. Uses curl with browser user-agent (urllib fails TLS on macOS), retries up to three times on short/empty responses, extracts exclusion sentences only after dropping quoted legislation so a quoted article is never mistaken for a real exclusion, and computes the hash by dynamically importing decision_text_hash.py to guarantee comparability with the bridge's recorded value.
