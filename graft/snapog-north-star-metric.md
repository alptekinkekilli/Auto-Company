## Summary

Canonical SQL for Weekly Active Producers (WAP): distinct api_key_id values generating at least one non-cached OG image (cache_hit=0) in a window. Cache hits are excluded because they represent edge-served static responses with near-zero marginal cost and no signal of new demand. Days with zero traffic produce no rows (zero-filling must happen client-side). Queries safe to run from dashboard, wrangler d1 execute, or the Cloudflare MCP d1_database_query tool.
