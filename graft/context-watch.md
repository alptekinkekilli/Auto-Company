## Summary

Claude Code hook that monitors context-window fullness during a session. Reads the transcript's usage field, sums input/cache tokens, auto-escalates the window size through tiers up to 2M, and emits a warning at 50% or a compact-ritual directive at 60% via hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext (must be nested there or silently ignored). State persisted per session in /tmp/context-watch-<sid>.json so each threshold fires once per session; a drop below 40% re-arms. Fail-open.
