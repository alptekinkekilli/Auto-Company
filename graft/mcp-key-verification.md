## Summary

Verifies each MCP server (Airtable, Linear, Context7) receives a well-formed API key after a deploy by inspecting the environment of the running auto-loop.sh process via /proc/<pid>/environ rather than its own shell environment — avoiding docker exec's fresh-shell environment which lacks entrypoint-sourced variables and caused false failures. Never prints key values, only lengths and shape status; fails with non-zero exit if a key is absent or malformed.
