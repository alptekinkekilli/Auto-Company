## Summary

Install/uninstall/status scripts for running the Auto Company auto-loop as a per-user systemd service in WSL, writing a unit file to ~/.config/systemd/user/auto-company.service with Restart=always and a 10-second delay. All guard systemctl calls with version checks and use || true so a missing service never aborts; the file removal is the authoritative uninstall action.
