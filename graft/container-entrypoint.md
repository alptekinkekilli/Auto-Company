## Summary

PID-1 bootstrap that drops privileges via gosu, stamps a boot-epoch file for the loop's MCP-config freshness gate, applies operator overrides from runtime.env (parsed literally to avoid shell-special-char corruption), and launches the dashboard and loop as background processes, restarting the container if either exits. Persists state across redeploys by symlinking docs/ and skills into the memories volume and relocating CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/CODEX_HOME onto the logs volume; seeds Codex auth only on first boot to avoid token-rotation 401s.
