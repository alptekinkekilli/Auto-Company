## Summary

Outreach outcome watcher classifying email replies, bounces, and silence for five real firms. Reports replies once and never as silence, flags bounces as delivery failures (explicitly not silence), keeps fresh sends quiet, and phrases silence alerts as observations ('hüküm değil'). Uses lexicographically comparable ISO timestamps and a 72-hour silence threshold; state persistence suppresses duplicate alerts; a failure superseded by a later Sent is not reported as a delivery problem.
