## Summary

PID-1 bootstrap that drops privileges to the app user via gosu, stamps a boot-epoch file for the loop's MCP-config freshness gate, applies operator overrides from runtime.env (parsed literally to avoid shell-special-character corruption), and launches the dashboard and auto-loop as background processes, restarting the container if either exits. Persists state across redeploys by symlinking docs/ and .claude/skills/ into the memories volume, relocating CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR and CODEX_HOME onto the logs volume, and seeding Codex auth only on first boot to avoid token-rotation 401s. Key guards: set +e around wait -n so a non-zero child exit still produces a diagnostic naming the dead process, a shadowing report for env vars overridden by runtime.env, and a TERM/INT trap forwarded to all children.
