## Summary

Watchers that audit the human directive and standing documentation. directive-staleness-watch.py alerts when the directive stays PENDING past a threshold (only market evidence or an explicit terminal decision can satisfy it), throttled via a persisted timestamp. directive-rule-sweep.py audits rule-like statements that exist only in ephemeral directive files and are not backed by standing docs, using a canary fixture (zibberflux) to verify the heuristic and exiting 3 on UNKNOWN to avoid false completeness.
