## Summary

A minimal JSON-RPC 2.0 stdio server configured entirely via env vars (MOCK_TOOLS, MOCK_CALL_TEXT, MOCK_CALL_ISERROR, MOCK_DIE) used as a deterministic stand-in for a real MCP server in integration tests. Ignores notifications, skips malformed JSON, always returns a result even for unknown methods.
