## Summary

Value-sensitive session-leak scanner for EKAP Bridge records, flagging only key-plus-value adjacencies (Set-Cookie: name=value, Authorization: Bearer <token>, named credential keys, populated localStorage dumps) while passing assurance sentences and public evidence fields. Has a selftest() with embedded fixtures that exits 3 on any misbehavior — a canary gate preventing the scanner from being trusted after a regression. Hardened 2026-07-29: authorization headers matched only when followed by a known scheme or opaque token, never bare prose, to avoid the original word-presence false positive.
