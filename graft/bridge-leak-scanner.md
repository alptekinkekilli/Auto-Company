## Summary

Value-sensitive session-leak scanner for EKAP Bridge records, flagging only key-plus-value adjacencies (Set-Cookie, Authorization: Bearer, named credential keys, populated localStorage) while passing assurance sentences and public evidence fields. Has an embedded selftest with a canary gate: exits 3 if any fixture misbehaves, refusing to report CLEAN after a regression. Hardened to match auth headers only when followed by a known scheme or opaque token, never bare prose.
