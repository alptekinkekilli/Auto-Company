## Summary

g4-check automates the G4 identity-attribution verdict for Turkish firms by testing a row's claim against live evidence rather than trusting the self-declared 'G4 PASS'. It requires both first-party contact (a domain owned by the firm) and an anchor to the registered identity (address with Turkish-aware normalization, registry number, or agreeing Profile bridge citation), reporting a claimed PASS that fails evidence as CLAIMED_PASS_UNVERIFIED rather than downgrading it. It reuses the render-first examiner site-contact-evidence.py and reads structured fields in addition to prose notes to avoid false 'no address' findings.
