## Summary

Single-call fetcher for Turkish public procurement (KİK) decision pages, returning a compact digest (decision number/date, authority, complainant distinguished from excluded firm, operative sentence, content hash). Uses curl with a browser UA (urllib fails TLS on macOS), retries on short responses, and drops quoted legislation before extracting exclusion sentences so a quoted article is never mistaken for a real exclusion. Hash computed by dynamically importing decision_text_hash.py to guarantee comparability with the bridge's recorded value.
