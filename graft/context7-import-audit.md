## Summary

context7-check.py audits AI assistant cycles to ensure external library imports are accompanied by a Context7 documentation lookup, flagging external imports without a lookup as CONTEXT7 NO-CHECK. Must not fire on the project's own ops scripts (stdlib only) to avoid false alarms that erode trust; parses payloads via JSON not regex to handle escaped quotes/newlines; reports scoped npm packages as @scope/pkg.
