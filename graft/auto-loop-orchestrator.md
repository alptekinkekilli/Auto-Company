## Summary

The 24/7 autonomous orchestration loop running Claude or Codex CLI engines in fresh sessions with memories/consensus.md as the cross-cycle relay. Implements a four-gate budget model (per-engine 5-hour, daily, weekly caps) backed by an idempotent spend ledger, a quota-aware engine router, a tier ladder for round-robin model/effort selection, and a circuit breaker with cooldown. Supports legacy cli and jcode harnesses with a tool denylist for safety, prompt guardrail verification against PROMPT.md, usage-limit detection with anchored error patterns, and permanent Codex auth failure detection that disables the engine for the run. Uses LOOP_BOOT_ID for unique run IDs across container restarts.
