## Summary

CLI harness that collapses the multi-step MCP browse-and-extract workflow into a single bash invocation, cutting context re-billing from ~5-9 chat turns per page to one. Read-only by design, walks URLs in one background tab via the BrowserOS MCP gateway, runs a fixed wait, optional server-side grep over rendered content (so SPAs are searched post-render), and a read, with output clipped at --max-bytes. Reports a timed-out wait as waited=timeout so zero grep matches are treated as inconclusive.
