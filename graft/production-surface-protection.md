## Summary

The tripwire guard (prod-mechanism-guard.py) that mechanically blocks unplanned writes to protected production surfaces (scripts/core/auto-loop.sh, dashboard/server.py, Dockerfile, runtime.env) unless a fresh 120-minute marker file exists. It is deliberately fail-open on malformed stdin and no-ops when CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR points to /app (deferring to PROMPT.md's OPREQ authorization machine). A --check-sync drift detector verifies every backtick-referenced surface in CLAUDE.md is covered. Philosophy is a tripwire, not a boundary — catching 'plansız dalma' rather than malicious intent.
