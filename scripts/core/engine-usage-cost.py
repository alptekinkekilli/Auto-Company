"""engine-usage-cost — token usage -> notional USD at Anthropic list prices.

Why this exists (jcode migration, gate 3): `claude -p --output-format json`
reports `total_cost_usd` and the APP-263 four-gate budget ledger is fed from
it. jcode reports token counts only (`done.usage` in --ndjson), so the ledger
needs this adapter to keep the gates seeing real numbers. A budget gate that
silently reads zero is not a brake — hence the conservative-unknown design:
an unknown model is priced at the most expensive known row times a safety
factor, loudly flagged, never zero. Set STRICT=1 to hard-fail instead.

Input (choose one):
  --usage-json '<json>'   usage object (Claude API field names)
  --ndjson-file PATH      jcode --ndjson event stream. ALL `tokens` events are
                          SUMMED — measured 2026-07-31: `done.usage` carries
                          the LAST request only, so trusting it on a
                          multi-tool cycle undercounts by the whole agentic
                          loop. The `done` event is used only for the model
                          name (it records what ACTUALLY ran, including
                          jcode's silent fallback on an unknown -m).
Output: one JSON line:
  {"model":..., "cost_usd":..., "estimated":false, "basis":"..."}
Exit codes: 0 ok; 2 bad input; 3 unknown model under STRICT=1.

Verified 2026-07-31 against claude CLI's own total_cost_usd / modelUsage on
live haiku-4-5 and sonnet-5 calls (see jcode-pilot acceptance log).
