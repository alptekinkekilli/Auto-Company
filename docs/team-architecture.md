# Team Architecture — selection map & output directories

Moved out of `CLAUDE.md` (2026-08-15) to keep the always-loaded context lean.
Agent definitions in `.claude/agents/` are authoritative (each file's
frontmatter states when to use it); this file is the human-readable selection
map and the `docs/<role>/` output mapping.
